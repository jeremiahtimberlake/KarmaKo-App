# KarmaKo  
KarmaKo is a speculative application that imagines a future world where constant surveillance is the norm and personal behavior is publicly quantified. Actions toward others are visible, and social reputation is distilled into a single metric: your KarmaScore.  

## At a Glance  
The KarmaKo app acts as a hub for multiple social domains—romance and sex, jobs, friendships, and housing. While it promises to make social connections easier, it also allows others to judge who you are based on your accumulated KarmaScore.

This first iteration focuses on the romance and sex component of the platform, GrindHr, a lesbian-oriented adaptation of Grindr.
